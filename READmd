# Week 4 Python Assignment – File Processor

# What it Does
This is a simple Python program that lets you:
- Open and read a text file
- Change its content (make it UPPERCASE, lowercase, count words, or reverse text)
- Save the modified version in a new file

---

# How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/makamu-okinyi/week-4-python-assignment-.git
   cd week-4-python-assignment-
2. Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python file_processor.py
3. Type the name of a file you want to process (e.g., notes.txt).

4. Pick an option:

1 → UPPERCASE

2 → lowercase

3 → count words

4 → reverse content

5. The result will be saved in a new file called:

php-template
Copy
Edit
modified_<filename>
⚠️ Notes
Make sure the file you want to process is in the same folder.

The program will tell you if the file doesn’t exist or you don’t have permission.
